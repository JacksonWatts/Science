cheetahs live <em>mainly</em> in the African savanna and are know for being the <strong>fastest land animal</strong>.</p><br> 
<p>the fastest land animal is in danger of <strong>extinction</strong> even though this may sound frightening there are a few things we can do, <ol><li>the first thing we can do is to try and stop the illegal pet trade.</li><li>eve nthough stopping the illegal pet trade may be a intimidating task another thing we could do is to stop expanding into cheetah teritory.</li><li>one last thing we could do would be to stop poaching </li></ol> if cheetahs do go extinct it will have great effect on many other animals in their ecosystem so it is vital that we fix this problem before it is too late.</p>
